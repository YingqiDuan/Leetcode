"""
Consider all codes made of four digits (0âˆ’9). How many of them have a sum of digits equal to S? For example, for S = 4, there are 35 such codes in total. Some of them are 0022, 1003, 1111, 2020, 4000.

Write a function:

int solution(int S);

that, given an integer S, returns the number of four-digit codes whose sum of digits is equal to S.

Examples:

For S = 35, the possible codes are: 9998, 9989, 9899, 8999. The function should return 4.
For S = 4, the function should return 35.
For S = 2, the function should return 10.
Assume that:

S is an integer within the range [0..36].
